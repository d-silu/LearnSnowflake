**Micro-Partitioning and Data Clustering**

- All data in Snowflake is stored in database tables, logically structured as collecitons of columns and rows.

- A *Partition* is a unit of management that is manipulated independently using specialized DDL and syntax.

- Limitiatitions of traditional static partitioning are data skew, maintenance overhead, dispropertionately-sized partitions.

- All data in Snowflake tables is automatically divided into micro-partitions, which are contiguous units of storage.

- Each micro-parition contains between 50 BM to 500 MB of uncompresed data.

- Groups of rows in a table are mapped into individual micro-partitions, organized in a columnar fashion.

- This size and structure allows for extremely granular pruning of very large tables.

- Snowflake stores metadata about all rows stored in a micro-partition:
  
  - The range of values for each of the columns in the micro-partition.
  
  - The number of distinct values.
  
  - Additional properties used for both optimization and efficient query processing.

- Micro-partitioning is automatically performed on all Snowflake tables.

- Tables are transparently partitioned using the ordering of the data as it is inserted or loaded.
  
  **Benefits of Micro Paritioning**
  
  - Snowflake micro-paritions are derived automatically, and don't require user intervention or maintenance.
  
  - Due to the small size of the micro-partitions, they enable extremely efficient DML and fine-grained pruning for faster queries.
  
  - Micro-partitions can overlap in their range of values, which combined with their uniformly small size, helps to prevent skew.
  
  - Columns are stored independently within micro-partitions referred as *columnar storage*, which enables efficient scanning of individual columns. Only the query referenced columns are scanned.
  
  - Columns are compressed individually within micro-partitions. Snowflake automatically determines the most efficient compression algorithm for the columns in each micro-partition. 

- DML operations take advantage of underlying micro-partiton metadata. e.g. Deleting all rows from a table are metadata-only operations.

- When a column in a table is dropped, the micro-partitions that contain the data for the dropped column are not re-written when the drop statement is executed. Instead the dropped column remains in storage.

- Snowflake uses columnar scanning of partitions so that an entire partition is not scanned if a query only filters by one column.

- *Not all predicate expressions can be used to prune*: Snowflake does not prune micro-partitions based on a predicate with a subquery, even if the subquery results in a constant.

**Data Clustering**

- In Snowflake, as data is inserted/loaded into a table, clustering metadata is collected and recorded for each micro-partition created during the process. 

- Snowflake then leverages this clustering information to avoid unnecessary scanning of micro-partitions during querying, significantly accelerating the performance of queries that reference these columns.

- Thy way Snowflake prunes queries:
  
  - First: Prune micro-partitions  that are not needed for the query.
  
  - Then: Prune by column within the remaining micro-paritions.

- Clustering metadat includes:
  
  - Total number of micro-partitions that comprise the table.
  
  - Number of micro-partitions containing values that overlap with each other.
  
  - Depth of the overlapping micro-partitions.

- A sequence is a counter. It can help you create unique ids for table rows. 

- There are ways to create unique ids within a single table called an AUTO-INCREMENT column. Those are easy to set up and work well in a single table. 

- A sequence can give you the power to split information across different tables and put the same ID in all tables as a way to make it easy to link them back together later.

- Snowflake Data Cloud makes it much easier and much cheaper to consume shared data rather than owning and maintaining local copies. 

- The real value of consuming shared data is:

    - Someone else will maintain it over time and keep it fresh
    - Someone else will pay to store it
    - You will only pay to query it

- You cannot grant access to a function using a button. You have to use code.

- Snowflake costs are based on Credits.

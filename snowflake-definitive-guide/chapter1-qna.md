   _Ans_: Snowflake automatically converts object names to uppercase. However if we need a mixed case or lower case, then we can use quotes ('') to do so.

9. We’ll be using the CREATE OR REPLACE statement in future chapters to create new Snowflake objects. Why is it better not to do this in a production environment?
